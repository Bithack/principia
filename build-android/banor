Help the robot get to the goal!
Touch and drag the wooden plank to move it on the screen. Rotate the plank by dragging the small rotation icon next to it.
When you are happy with how you placed it, click the play button to try it out.

It's time to start building! Place the edge of one plank against another plank, a small hammer symbol will appear.
Click the hammer to nail the two planks together. To remove all nails from a plank, first select the plank by touching it
and then click on the second button in the bottom left corner of the screen.
Try to build something that allows the robot to reach the goal.

Well look what we have here, a door is blocking the robot's path! There seems to be some kind of suspicious button
hooked up to the door's security system, maybe you should try to make an object press it.
