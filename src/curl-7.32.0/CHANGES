  KNOWN_BUGS: 22 and 57 have been fixed and committed

- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with d20def20462e7

- global dns cache: fix memory leak
  
  The take down of the global dns cache didn't take CURLOPT_RESOLVE names
  into account.

- global dns cache: didn't work [regression]
  
  CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE broke in commit c43127414d89ccb (been
  broken since the libcurl 7.29.0 release). While this option has been
  documented as deprecated for almost a decade and nobody even reported
  this bug, it should remain functional.
  
  Added test case 1512 to verify

  packages/vms: update VMS build files
  
  VMS modified files either missing from a previous commit and changes
  to remove references to CVS repositories.

Daniel Stenberg (8 Aug 2013)
- FTP: renamed several local functions
  
  The previous naming scheme ftp_state_post_XXXX() wasn't really helpful
  as it wasn't always immediately after 'xxxx' and it wasn't easy to
  understand what it does based on such a name.
  
  This new one is instead ftp_state_yyyy() where yyyy describes what it
  does or sends.

- mk-ca-bundle.1: don't install on make install
  
  Since the mk-ca-bundle tool itself isn't installed with make install,

Daniel Stenberg (6 Aug 2013)
- LIBCURL-STRUCTS: new document
  
  This is the first version of this new document, detailing the seven
  perhaps most important internal structs in libcurl source code:
  
    1.1 SessionHandle
    1.2 connectdata
    1.3 Curl_multi
    1.4 Curl_handler
    1.5 conncache
    1.6 Curl_share
    1.7 CookieInfo

- CONTRIBUTE: minor language polish

- FTP: when EPSV gets a 229 but fails to connect, retry with PASV
  
  This is a regression as this logic used to work. It isn't clear when it
  broke, but I'm assuming in 7.28.0 when we went all-multi internally.
  
  This likely never worked with the multi interface. As the failed
  connection is detected once the multi state has reached DO_MORE, the
  Curl_do_more() function was now expanded somewhat so that the
  ftp_do_more() function can request to go "back" to the previous state
  when it makes another attempt - using PASV.
  
  Added test case 1233 to verify this fix. It has the little issue that it
  assumes no service is listening/accepting connections on port 1...

Nick Zitzmann (5 Aug 2013)
- md5: remove use of CommonCrypto-to-OpenSSL macros for the benefit of Leopard
  
  For some reason, OS X 10.5's GCC suddenly stopped working correctly with
  macros that change MD5_Init etc. in the code to CC_MD5_Init etc., so I
  worked around this by removing use of the macros and inserting static
  functions that just call CommonCrypto's implementations of the functions
  instead.

Guenter Knauf (5 Aug 2013)
- Simplify check for trusted certificates.
  
  This changes the previous check for untrusted certs to a check for
  certs explicitely marked as trusted.
  The change is backward-compatible (tested with certdata.txt v1.80).

Daniel Stenberg (5 Aug 2013)
- configure: warn on bad env variable use, don't error
  
  Use XC_CHECK_BUILD_FLAGS instead XC_CHECK_USER_FLAGS.

  This reverts commit 6b27703b5f525eccdc0a8409f51de8595c75132a.

- formadd: wrong pointer for file name when CURLFORM_BUFFERPTR used
  
  The internal function that's used to detect known file extensions for
  the default Content-Type got the the wrong pointer passed in when
  CURLFORM_BUFFER + CURLFORM_BUFFERPTR were used. This had the effect that
  strlen() would be used which could lead to an out-of-bounds read (and
  thus segfault). In most cases it would only lead to it not finding or
  using the correct default content-type.
  
  It also showed that test 554 and test 587 were testing for the
  previous/wrong behavior and now they're updated as well.

- Skip more untrusted certificates.
  
  Christian Heimes brought to our attention that the certdata.txt
  format has recently changed [1], causing ca-bundle.crt created
  with mk-ca-bundle.[pl|vbs] to include untrusted certs.

Daniel Stenberg (4 Aug 2013)
- configure: don't error out on variable confusions, just warn

- configure: rephrase the notice in _XC_CHECK_VAR_*
  
  Instead of claiming it is an error, we call it a "note" to reduce the
  severity level. But the following text now says the [variable] "*should*
  only be used to specify"... instead of previously having said "may".

- multi: remove data->state.current_conn struct field
  
  Not needed

- multi: remove the one_easy struct field
  
  Since the merge of SessionHandle with Curl_one_easy, this indirection
  isn't used anymore.

- multi: rename all Curl_one_easy to SessionHandle

- multi: remove the multi_pos struct field
  
  Since Curl_one_easy is really a SessionHandle now, this indirection
  doesn't exist anymore.

- multi: remove easy_handle struct field
  
  It isn't needed anymore

- multi: remove 'Curl_one_easy' struct, phase 1
  
  The motivation for having a separate struct that keep track of an easy
  handle when using the multi handle was removed when we switched to
  always using the multi interface internally. Now they were just two
  separate struct that was always allocated for each easy handle.
  
  This first step just moves the Curl_one_easy struct members into the
  SessionHandle struct and hides this somehow (== keeps the source code
  changes to a minimum) by defining Curl_one_easy to SessionHandle
  
  The biggest changes in this commit are:
  
   1 - the linked list of easy handles had to be changed somewhat due
       to the new struct layout. This made the main linked list pointer
       get renamed to 'easyp' and there's also a new pointer to the last
       node, called easylp. It is no longer circular but ends with ->next
       pointing to NULL. New nodes are still added last.
  
   2 - easy->state is now called easy->mstate to avoid name collision

Steve Holme (2 Aug 2013)
- Revert "DOCS: Added IMAP URL example for listing new messages"
  
  This reverts commit 82ab5f1b0c7c3f as this was the wrong place to
  document the complexity of IMAP URLs and Custom Requests.

  In addition to listing the folder contents, in the URL examples, added
  an example to list the new messages waiting in the user's inbox.

- packages/vms/Makefile.am: add latest file additions to EXTRA_DIST

- [John Malmberg brought this change]

  Add in the files needed to build libcurl shared images on VMS.
  
  Update the packages/vms/readme file to be current.
  
  Also some files for the GNV based build were either missing or needed an
  update.
  
  curl_crtl_init.c is a special file that is run before main() to
  set up the proper C runtime behavior.
  
  generate_vax_transfer.com generates the VAX transfer vector modules from
  the gnv_libcurl_symbols.opt file.
  
  gnv_conftest.c_first is a helper file needed for configure scripts to
  come up with the expected answers on VMS.
  
  gnv_libcurl_symbols.opt is the public symbols for the libcurl shared
  image.
  
  gnv_link_curl.com builds the shared libcurl image and rebuilds other
  programs to use it.
  
  macro32_exactcase.patch is a hack to make a local copy of the VMS Macro32
  assembler case sensitive, which is needed to build the VAX transfer modules.
  
  report_openssl_version.c is a tool for help verify that the libcurl
  shared image is being built for a minium version of openssl.

- curl: --progress-bar max update frequency now at 5Hz

- curl: make --progress-bar update the line less frequently
  
  Also, use memset() instead of a lame loop.
  
  The previous logic that tried to avoid too many updates were very
  ineffective for really fast transfers, as then it could easily end up
  doing hundreds of updates per second that would make a significant
  impact in transfer performance!

- darwinssl: added LFs to some strings passed into infof()
  
  (This doesn't need to appear in the release notes.) I noticed a few places
  where infof() was called, and there should've been an LF at the end of the
  string, but there wasn't.

- darwinssl: fix build error in crypto authentication under Snow Leopard
  
  It turns out Snow Leopard not only has SecItemCopyMatching() defined in
  a header not included by the omnibus header, but it won't work for our
  purposes, because searching for SecIdentityRef objects wasn't added
  to that API until Lion. So we now use the old SecKeychainSearch API
  instead if the user is building under, or running under, Snow Leopard.

  curl_formadd: fix file upload on VMS
  
  For the standard VMS text file formats, VMS needs to read the file to
  get the actual file size.
  
  For the standard VMS binary file formats, VMS needs a special format of
  fopen() call so that it stops reading at the logical end of file instead
  of at the end of the blocks allocated to the file.
  
  I structured the patch this way as I was not sure about changing the
  structures or parameters to the routines, but would prefer to only call
  the stat() function once and pass the information to where the fopen()
  call is made.
  
  Bug: https://sourceforge.net/p/curl/bugs/758/

- formadd: CURLFORM_FILECONTENT wrongly rejected some option combos
  
  The code for CURLFORM_FILECONTENT had its check for duplicate options
  wrong so that it would reject CURLFORM_PTRNAME if used in combination

  purpose cannot be interpreted that broadly.

  curl: fix upload of a zip file in OpenVMS
  
  Two fixes:
  
  1. Force output file format to be stream-lf so that partial downloads
  can be continued.
  
  This should have minor impact as if the file does not exist, it was
  created with stream-lf format.  The only time this was an issue is if
  there was already an existing file with a different format.
  
  2. Fix file uploads are now fixed.
  
     a. VMS binary files such as ZIP archives are now uploaded
        correctly.
  
     b. VMS text files are read once to get the correct size
        and then converted to line-feed terminated records as
        they are read into curl.
  
  The default VMS text formats do not contain either line-feed or
  carriage-return terminated records.  Those delimiters are added by the
  operating system file read calls if the application requests them.

- CURLOPT_XFERINFOFUNCTION: introducing a new progress callback
  
  CURLOPT_XFERINFOFUNCTION is now the preferred progress callback function
  and CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION is considered deprecated.
  
  This new callback uses pure 'curl_off_t' arguments to pass on full
  resolution sizes. It otherwise retains the same characteristics: the
  same call rate, the same meanings for the arguments and the return code
  is used the same way.
  
  The progressfunc.c example is updated to show how to use the new
  callback for newer libcurls while supporting the older one if built with
  an older libcurl or even built with a newer libcurl while running with
  an older.

- Reinstate "WIN32 MemoryTracking: track wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() usage".
  
  This reverts commit 7ed25cc, reinstating commit 8ec2cb5.
  
  As of 18-jul-2013 we still do have code in libcurl that makes use of these
  memory functions. Commit 8ec2cb5 comment still applies and is yet valid.
  
  These memory functions are solely used in Windows builds, so all related
  code is protected with '#ifdef WIN32' preprocessor conditional compilation
  directives.
  
  Specifically, wcsdup() _wcsdup() are used when building a Windows target with
  UNICODE and USE_WINDOWS_SSPI preprocessor symbols defined. This is the case
  when building a Windows UNICODE target with Windows native SSL/TLS support
  enabled.
  
  Realizing that wcsdup() _wcsdup() are used is a bit tricky given that usage
  of these is hidden behind _tcsdup() which is MS way of dealing with code
  that must tolerate UNICODE and non-UNICODE compilation. Additionally, MS
  header files and those compatible from other compilers use this preprocessor
  conditional compilation directive in order to select at compilation time
  whether 'wide' or 'ansi' MS API functions are used.
  
  Without this code, Windows build targets with Windows native SSL/TLS support
  enabled and MemoryTracking support enabled misbehave in tracking memory usage,
  regardless of being a UNICODE enabled build or not.

- darwinssl: SSLv2 connections are aborted if unsupported by the OS
  
  I just noticed that OS X no longer supports SSLv2. Other TLS engines return
  an error if the requested protocol isn't supported by the underlying
  engine, so we do that now for SSLv2 if the framework returns an error
  when trying to turn on SSLv2 support. (Note: As always, SSLv2 support is
  only enabled in curl when starting the app with the -2 argument; it's off
  by default. SSLv2 is really old and insecure.)

  The 10 first bug fixes for the pending release...

- formpost: better random boundaries
  
  When doing multi-part formposts, libcurl used a pseudo-random value that
  was seeded with time(). This turns out to be bad for users who formpost
  data that is provided with users who then can guess how the boundary
  string will look like and then they can forge a different formpost part
  and trick the receiver.
  
  My advice to such implementors is (still even after this change) to not
  rely on the boundary strings being cryptographically strong. Fix your
  code and logic to not depend on them that much!
  
  I moved the Curl_rand() function into the sslgen.c source file now to be
  able to take advantage of the SSL library's random function if it
  provides one. If not, try to use the RANDOM_FILE for seeding and as a
  last resort keep the old logic, just modified to also add microseconds
  which makes it harder to properly guess the exact seed.
  
  The formboundary() function in formdata.c is now using 64 bit entropy
  for the boundary and therefore the string of dashes was reduced by 4
  letters and there are 16 hex digits following it. The total length is
  thus still the same.
  
  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1251
  Reported-by: "Floris"

- printf: make sure %x are treated unsigned
  
  When using %x, the number must be treated as unsigned as otherwise it
  would get sign-extended on for example 64bit machines and do wrong
  output. This problem showed when doing printf("%08x", 0xffeeddcc) on a
  64bit host.

- tests: add test1395 to the tarball

- SIGPIPE: don't use 'data' in sigpipe restore
  
  Follow-up fix from 7d80ed64e43515.
  
  The SessionHandle may not be around to use when we restore the sigpipe
  sighandler so we store the no_signal boolean in the local struct to know
  if/how to restore.

- TODO: 1.8 Modified buffer size approach
  
  Thoughts around buffer sizes and what might be possible to do...

- c-ares: improve error message on failed resolve
  
  When the c-ares based resolver backend failed to resolve a name, it
  tried to show the name that failed from existing structs. This caused
  the wrong output and shown hostname when for example --interface
  [hostname] was used and that name resolving failed.
  
  Now we use the hostname used in the actual resolve attempt in the error
  message as well.
  
  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1191
  Reported-by: Kim Vandry

- ossl_recv: check for an OpenSSL error, don't assume
  
  When we recently started to treat a zero return code from SSL_read() as
  an error we also got false positives - which primarily looks to be
  because the OpenSSL documentation is wrong and a zero return code is not
  at all an error case in many situations.
  
  Now ossl_recv() will check with ERR_get_error() to see if there is a
  stored error and only then consider it to be a true error if SSL_read()
  returned zero.

  Security problem: CVE-2013-2174
  
  If a program would give a string like "%FF" to curl_easy_unescape() but
  ask for it to decode only the first byte, it would still parse and
  decode the full hex sequence. The function then not only read beyond the
  allowed buffer but it would also deduct the *unsigned* counter variable
  for how many more bytes there's left to read in the buffer by two,
  making the counter wrap. Continuing this, the function would go on
  reading beyond the buffer and soon writing beyond the allocated target
  buffer...

  ossl_recv: SSL_read() returning 0 is an error too
  
  SSL_read can return 0 for "not successful", according to the open SSL
  documentation: http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_read.html

- [Mike Giancola brought this change]

  ossl_send: SSL_write() returning 0 is an error too
  
  We found that in specific cases if the connection is abruptly closed,
  the underlying socket is listed in a close_wait state. We continue to
  call the curl_multi_perform, curl_mutli_fdset etc. None of these APIs
  report the socket closed / connection finished.  Since we have cases
  where the multi connection is only used once, this can pose a problem
  for us. I've read that if another connection was to come in, curl would
  see the socket as bad and attempt to close it at that time -
  unfortunately, this does not work for us.
  
  I found that in specific situations, if SSL_write returns 0, curl did
  not recognize the socket as closed (or errored out) and did not report
  it to the application. I believe we need to change the code slightly, to
  check if ssl_write returns 0. If so, treat it as an error - the same as
  a negative return code.

  netscape cookie spec had this oddity mentioned and while our code
  decreased the check to only check for two, the existing cookie spec has

  cookies: only consider full path matches
  
  I found a bug which cURL sends cookies to the path not to aim at.
  For example:
  - cURL sends a request to http://example.fake/hoge/
  - server returns cookie which with path=/hoge;
    the point is there is NOT the '/' end of path string.
  - cURL sends a request to http://example.fake/hogege/ with the cookie.
  
  The reason for this old "feature" is because that behavior is what is
  described in the original netscape cookie spec:
  http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html

  as the default behaviour of SMTP AUTH responses is now to not include
  the initial response. New tests with --sasl-ir support to follow.

- imap: Added support for overriding the SASL initial response
  
  In addition to checking for the SASL-IR capability the user can override
  the sending of the client's initial response in the AUTHENTICATION
  command with the use of CURLOPT_SASL_IR should the server erroneously
  not report SASL-IR when it does support it.

- smtp: Added support for disabling the SASL initial response
  
  Updated the default behaviour of sending the client's initial response in the AUTH
  command to not send it and added support for CURLOPT_SASL_IR to allow the user to
  specify including the response.

- pop3: Added support for enabling the SASL initial response
  
  Allowed the user to specify whether to send the client's intial response
  in the AUTH command via CURLOPT_SASL_IR.

- curl_easy_init: use less mallocs
  
  By introducing an internal alternative to curl_multi_init() that accepts
  parameters to set the hash sizes, easy handles will now use tiny socket
  and connection hash tables since it will only ever add a single easy
  handle to that multi handle.
  
  This decreased the number mallocs in test 40 (which is a rather simple
  and typical easy interface use case) from 1142 to 138. The maximum
  amount of memory allocated used went down from 118969 to 78805.

- ftp_state_pasv_resp: connect through proxy also when set by env
  
  When connecting back to an FTP server after having sent PASV/EPSV,
  libcurl sometimes didn't use the proxy properly even though the proxy
  was used for the initial connect.
  
  The function wrongly checked for the CURLOPT_PROXY variable to be set,
  which made it act wrongly if the proxy information was set with an
  environment variable.
  
  Added test case 711 to verify (based on 707 which uses --socks5). Also
  added test712 to verify another variation of setting the proxy: with
  --proxy socks5://

- url: Fixed crash when no username or password supplied for proxy
  
  Fixed an issue in parse_proxy(), introduced in commit 11332577b3cb,

- url: Simplified setstropt_userpwd() following recent changes
  
  There is no need to perform separate clearing of data if a NULL option

  In addition to parsing the optional login options from the URL, added
  support for parsing them from CURLOPT_USERPWD, to allow the following
  supported command line:
  
  --user username:password;options

- url: Added bounds checking to parse_login_details()
  
  Added bounds checking when searching for the separator characters within
  the login string as this string may not be NULL terminated (For example
  it is the login part of a URL). We do this in preference to allocating a
  new string to copy the login details into which could then be passed to
  parse_login_details() for performance reasons.

- FTP: wait on both connections during active STOR state
  
  When doing PORT and upload (STOR), this function needs to extract the
  file descriptor for both connections so that it will respond immediately
  when the server eventually connects back.
  
  This flaw caused active connections to become unnecessary slow but they
  would still often work due to the normal polling on a timeout. The bug
  also would not occur if the server connected back very fast, like when
  testing on local networks.

  connect: treat an interface bindlocal() problem as a non-fatal error
  
  I am using curl_easy_setopt(CURLOPT_INTERFACE, "if!something") to force
  transfers to use a particular interface but the transfer fails with
  CURLE_INTERFACE_FAILED, "Failed binding local connection end" if the
  interface I specify has no IPv6 address. The cause is as follows:
  
  The remote hostname resolves successfully and has an IPv6 address and an
  IPv4 address.
  
  cURL attempts to connect to the IPv6 address first.
  
  bindlocal (in lib/connect.c) fails because Curl_if2ip cannot find an
  IPv6 address on the interface.
  
  This is a fatal error in singleipconnect()
  
  This change will make cURL try the next IP address in the list.
  
  Also included are two changes related to IPv6 address scope:
  
  - Filter the choice of address in Curl_if2ip to only consider addresses
  with the same scope ID as the connection address (mismatched scope for
  local and remote address does not result in a working connection).
  
  - bindlocal was ignoring the scope ID of addresses returned by
  Curl_if2ip . Now it uses them.

- SO_SNDBUF: don't set SNDBUF for win32 versions vista or later
  
  The Microsoft knowledge-base article
  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/823764 describes how to use SNDBUF to
  overcome a performance shortcoming in winsock, but it doesn't apply to
  Windows Vista and later versions. If the described SNDBUF magic is
  applied when running on those more recent Windows versions, it seems to
  instead have the reversed effect in many cases and thus make libcurl
  perform less good on those systems.
  
  This fix thus adds a run-time version-check that does the SNDBUF magic
  conditionally depending if it is deemed necessary or not.

- NTLM: fix several NTLM code paths memory leaks

- WIN32 MemoryTracking: track wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() usage
  
  As of 25-mar-2013 wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() are only used in
  WIN32 specific code, so tracking of these has not been extended for
  other build targets. Without this fix, memory tracking system on
  WIN32 builds, when using these functions, would provide misleading
  results.
  
  In order to properly extend this support for all targets curl.h
  would have to define curl_wcsdup_callback prototype and consequently
  wchar_t should be visible before that in curl.h.  IOW curl_wchar_t
  defined in curlbuild.h and this pulling whatever system header is
  required to get wchar_t definition.
  
  Additionally a new curl_global_init_mem() function that also receives
  user defined wcsdup() callback would be required.

- HTTP proxy: insert slash in URL if missing
  
  curl has been accepting URLs using slightly wrong syntax for a long
  time, such as when completely missing as slash "http://example.org" or
  missing a slash when a query part is given
  "http://example.org?q=foobar".
  
  curl would translate these into a legitimate HTTP request to servers,
  although as was shown in bug #1206 it was not adjusted properly in the
  cases where a HTTP proxy was used.
  
  Test 1213 and 1214 were added to the test suite to verify this fix.
  
  The test HTTP server was adjusted to allow us to specify test number in
  the host name only without using any slashes in a given URL.

- pipelining: Remove dead code.

- Multiple pipelines and limiting the number of connections.
  
  Introducing a number of options to the multi interface that
  allows for multiple pipelines to the same host, in order to
  optimize the balance between the penalty for opening new
  connections and the potential pipelining latency.
  
  Two new options for limiting the number of connections:
  
  CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS - Limits the number of running connections
  to the same host. When adding a handle that exceeds this limit,
  that handle will be put in a pending state until another handle is
  finished, so we can reuse the connection.
  
  CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS - Limits the number of connections in total.
  When adding a handle that exceeds this limit,
  that handle will be put in a pending state until another handle is
  finished. The free connection will then be reused, if possible, or
  closed if the pending handle can't reuse it.
  
  Several new options for pipelining:
  
  CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH - Limits the pipeling length. If a
  pipeline is "full" when a connection is to be reused, a new connection
  will be opened if the CURLMOPT_MAX_xxx_CONNECTIONS limits allow it.
  If not, the handle will be put in a pending state until a connection is
  ready (either free or a pipe got shorter).
  
  CURLMOPT_CONTENT_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE - A pipelined connection will not
  be reused if it is currently processing a transfer with a content
  length that is larger than this.
  
  CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE - A pipelined connection will not
  be reused if it is currently processing a chunk larger than this.
  
  CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SITE_BL - A blacklist of hosts that don't allow
  pipelining.
  
  CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SERVER_BL - A blacklist of server types that don't allow
  pipelining.
  
  See the curl_multi_setopt() man page for details.

  tool_main.c: fix VMS global variable storage-class specifier
  
  An extern submits a psect and a global reference to the linker to point

  The use of the extern by itself does declare a psect but does not declare
  a globalsymbol. It does declare a globalref. But the linker needs one and
  only one globaldef or there is an error.

  imap: Updated ftpserver.pl to be more compliant, added new commands
  
  Enriched IMAP capabilities of ftpserver.pl in order to be able to
  add tests for the new IMAP features.
  
  * Added support for APPEND - Saves uploaded data to log/upload.$testno
  * Added support for LIST - Returns the contents of <reply/> section in
    the current test, like e.g FETCH.
  * Added support for STORE - Returns hardcoded updated flags
  * Changed handling of SELECT - Returns much more information in the
    usual set of untagged responses; uses hardcoded data from an example
    in the IMAP RFC
  * Changed handling of FETCH - Fixed response format

- imap: Added check for empty UID in FETCH command
  
  As the UID has to be specified by the user for the FETCH command to work

- AddFormData: prevent only directories from being posted
  
  Commit f4cc54cb4746ae5a6d (shipped as part of the 7.29.0 release) was a
  bug fix that introduced a regression in that while trying to avoid
  allowing directory names, it also forbade "special" files like character
  devices and more. like "/dev/null" as was used by Oliver who reported
  this regression.

- darwinssl: fix infinite loop if server disconnected abruptly
  
  If the server hung up the connection without sending a closure alert,
  then we'd keep probing the socket for data even though it's dead. Now
  we're ready for this situation.

- pingpong.c: Fix enumerated type mixed with another type

- smtp: Updated the coding style for state changes after a send operation
  
  Some state changes would be performed after a failure test that
  performed a hard return, whilst others would be performed within a test
  for success. Updated the code, for consistency, so all instances are
  performed within a success test.

- pop3: Updated the coding style for state changes after a send operation
  
  Some state changes would be performed after a failure test that

  imap: Fixed custom request handling in imap_done()
  
  Fixed imap_done() so that neither the FINAL states are not entered when
  a custom command has been performed.

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  imap: Enabled custom requests in imap_select_resp()
  
  Changed imap_select_resp() to invoke imap_custom() instead of
  imap_fetch() after the mailbox has been selected if a custom
  command has been set.

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  imap: Enabled custom requests in imap_perform()
  
  Modified imap_perform() to start with the custom command instead of
  SELECT when a custom command is to be performed and no mailbox has
  been given.

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  imap: Added custom request perform and response handler functions
  
  Added imap_custom(), which initiates the custom command processing,
  and an associated response handler imap_state_custom_resp(), which
  handles any responses by sending them to the client as body data.
  
  All untagged responses with the same name as the first word of the
  custom request string are accepted, with the exception of SELECT and
  EXAMINE which have responses that cannot be easily identified. An
  extra check has been provided for them so that any untagged responses
  are accepted for them.

- pop3: Fixed unnecessary parent structure reference
  
  Updated pop3 code following recent imap changes.

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  imap: Added custom request parsing
  
  Added imap_parse_custom_request() for parsing the CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST
  parameter which URL decodes the value and separates the request from
  any parameters - This makes it easier to filter untagged responses
  by the request command.

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  remove the hard returns.

- imap: Changed successful response logic in imap_state_append_resp()
  
  For consistency changed the logic of the imap_state_append_resp()
  function to test for an unsucessful continuation response rather than a
  succesful one.

- imap: Standardised imapcode condition tests
  
  For consistency changed two if(constant != imapcode) tests to be
  if(imapcode != constant).

- imap: Moved imap_append() to be with the other perform functions

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  imap: Enabled APPEND support in imap_perform()
  
  Added logic in imap_perform() to perform an APPEND rather than SELECT
  and FETCH if an upload has been specified.

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  imap: Implemented APPEND final processing
  
  The APPEND operation needs to be performed in several steps:
    1) We send "<tag> APPEND <mailbox> <flags> {<size>}\r\n"
    2) Server responds with continuation respose "+ ...\r\n"
    3) We start the transfer and send <size> bytes of data
    4) Only now we end the request command line by sending "\r\n"
    5) Server responds with "<tag> OK ...\r\n"
  
  This commit performs steps 4 and 5, in the DONE phase, as more
  processing is required after the transfer.

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  imap: Added APPEND perform and response handler functions
  
  Added imap_append() function to initiate upload and imap_append_resp()
  to handle the continuation response and start the transfer.

  continuation data.

- imap: Fixed accidentally lossing the result code
  
  Accidentally lost the result code in imap_state_capability() and
  imap_state_login() with commit b06a78622609.

- imap: Another minor comment addition / tidy up

- imap: Updated the coding style for state changes after a send operation
  
  Some state changes would be performed after a failure test that
  performed a hard return, whilst others would be performed within a test
  for success. Updated the code, for consistency, so all instances are
  performed within a success test.

  imap: Fixed error code returned for invalid FETCH response
  
  If the FETCH command does not result in an untagged response the the
  UID is probably invalid. As such do not return CURLE_OK.

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  imap: Added processing of the final FETCH responses
  
  Not processing the final FETCH responses was not optimal, not only
  because the response code would be ignored but it would also leave data
  unread on the socket which would prohibit connection reuse.

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  imap: Introduced FETCH_FINAL state for processing final fetch responses
  
  A typical FETCH response can be broken down into four parts:
  
    1) "* <uid> FETCH (<what> {<size>}\r\n", using continuation syntax
    2) <size> bytes of the actual message
    3) ")\r\n", finishing the untagged response
    4) "<tag> OK ...", finishing the command
  
  Part 1 is read in imap_fetch_resp(), part 2 is consumed in the PERFORM
  phase by the transfer subsystem, parts 3 and 4 are currently ignored.

- imap: fix autobuild warning
  
  Removed whitespace from imap_perform()

  with the response function.

- imap: Re-factored final IMAP_AUTHENTICATE constant
  
  Changed the final IMAP_AUTHENTICATE constant to IMAP_AUTHENTICATE_FINAL
  for consistency with the response function.

- imap: Updated the coding style of imap_state_servergreet_resp()
  
  Updated the coding style, in this function, to be consistant with other
  response functions rather then performing a hard return on failure.

- imap: Reversed the logic of the (un)successful tagged SELECT response
  
  Reversed the logic of the unsuccessful vs successful tagged SELECT
  response in imap_state_select_resp() to be more logical to read.

- imap: Reversed the logic of the (un)successful tagged CAPABILITY response
  
  Reversed the logic of the unsuccessful vs successful tagged CAPABILITY
  response in imap_state_capability_resp() to be more logical to read.

- imap: Corrected char* references with char *
  
  Corrected char* references made in commit: 709b3506cd9b.

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  imap: Added processing of more than one response when sent in same packet
  
  Added a loop to imap_statemach_act() in which Curl_pp_readresp() is
  called until the cache is drained. Without this multiple responses
  received in a single packet could result in a hang or delay.

  imap: Added filtering of CAPABILITY and FETCH untagged responses
  
  Only responses that contain "CAPABILITY" and "FETCH", respectively,
  will be sent to their response handler.

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  imap: Added a helper function for upcoming untagged response filtering
  
  RFC 3501 states that "the client MUST be prepared to accept any response
  at all times" yet we assume anything received with "* " at the beginning
  is the untagged response we want.
  
  Introduced a helper function that checks whether the input looks like a
  response to specified command, so that we may filter the ones we are
  interested in according to the current state.

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  imap: Moved CAPABILITY response handling to imap_state_capability_resp()
  
  Introduced similar handling to the FETCH responses, where even the
  untagged data responses are handled by the response handler of the
  individual state.

  imap: Added the ability to FETCH a specific UID and SECTION
  
  Updated the FETCH command to send the UID and SECTION parsed from the
  URL. By default the BODY specifier doesn't include a section, BODY[] is
  now sent whereas BODY[TEXT] was previously sent. In my opinion
  retrieving just the message text is rarely useful when dealing with
  emails, as the headers are required for example, so that functionality
  is not retained. In can however be simulated by adding SECTION=TEXT to
  the URL.
  
  Also updated test801 and test1321 due to the BODY change.

  Fixed checking the socket if there is data waiting in the cache

- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]

  pingpong: Introduce Curl_pp_moredata()
  
  A simple function to test whether the PP is not sending and there are
  still more data in its receiver cache. This will be later utilized to:
  
  1) Change Curl_pp_multi_statemach() and Curl_pp_easy_statemach() to
     not test socket state and just call user's statemach_act() function
     when there are more data to process, because otherwise the task would
     just hang, waiting for more data from the socket.
  
  2) Allow PP users to read multiple responses by looping as long as there
     are more data available and current phase is not finished.
     (Currently needed for correct processing of IMAP SELECT responses.)

- metalink_cleanup: yet another follow-up fix

- metalink_cleanup: define it without argument
  
  Since the function takes no argument, the macro shouldn't take one as
  some compilers will error out on that.

- rename "easy" statemachines: call them block instead
  
  ... since they're not used by the easy interface really, I wanted to
  remove the association. Also, I unified the pingpong statemachine driver
  into a single function with a 'wait' argument: Curl_pp_statemach.

- smtp.c: Fixed a trailing whitespace
  
  Remove tailing whitespace introduced in commit 7ed689d24a4e.

- pop3: Fixed blocking SSL connect when connecting via POP3S
  
  A call to Curl_ssl_connect() was accidentally left in when the SSL/TLS
  connection layer was reworked in 7.29. Not only would this cause the
  connection to block but had the additional overhead of calling the
  non-blocking connect a little bit later.

  Renamed smtp_state_auth_resp() function to match the implementations in
  IMAP and POP3.

- remove ifdefs
  
  Clarify the code by reducing ifdefs

- strlcat: remove function
  
  This function was only used twice, both in places where performance
  isn't crucial (socks + if2ip). Removing the use of this function removes
  the need to have our private version for systems without it == reduced
  amount of code.
  
  Also, in the SOCKS case it is clearly better to fail gracefully rather
  than to truncate the results.
  
  This work was triggered by a bug report on the strcal prototype in
  strequal.h.
  
  strlcat was added in commit db70cd28 in February 2001!

- install-sh: updated to support multiple source files as arguments
  
  Version 7.29.0 uses Makefiles generated with a newer version of the
  autotools than the previous 7.28.1. These Makefiles try to install
  e.g. header files by calling install-sh with multiple source files as
  arguments. The bundled install-sh is to old and does not support this.
  
  The problem only occurs, if install-sh is actually being used, ie. the
  platform install executable is to old or not usable. Example: Solaris
  10.
  
  The files install-sh and mkinstalldirs are now updated with the automake
  1.11.3 versions. A better fix might be to completely remove them from
  git and force the files to be added/created during buildconf.

  An ambiguity in the SSLWrite() documentation lead to a bad inference in the

  the socket, when that is not actually true; it returns the amount of data
  that is buffered for writing to the socket if it returns errSSLWouldBlock.
  Now darwinssl_send() returns CURLE_AGAIN if data is buffered but not written.

- pingpong: Optimised the endofresp() function
  
  Reworked the pp->endofresp() function so that the conndata, line and
  line length are passed down to it just as with Curl_client_write()

- [Eldar Zaitov brought this change]

  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message: fix buffer overflow
  
  When negotiating SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication, the function
  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() uses the data provided from the
  server without doing the proper length checks and that data is then
  appended to a local fixed-size buffer on the stack.
  
  This vulnerability can be exploited by someone who is in control of a
  server that a libcurl based program is accessing with POP3, SMTP or
  IMAP. For applications that accept user provided URLs, it is also
  thinkable that a malicious user would feed an application with a URL to
  a server hosting code targetting this flaw.

- [John E. Malmberg brought this change]

  VMS: fix and generate the VMS build config
  
  config_h.com is a new file that generates a config.h file based on the
  curl_config.h.in file and a quick scan of the configure script.  This is
  actually a generic procedure that is shared with other VMS packages.
  
  The existing pre-built config-vms.h had over 100 entries that were not
  correct and in some cases conflicted with the build options available in
  the build_vms.com.
  
  generate_config_vms_h_curl.com is a helper procedure to the
  config_h.com.  It covers the cases that the generic config_h.com is not
  able to figure out, and accepts input from the build_vms.com procedure.
  
  build_curlbuild_h.com is a new file to generate the curlbuild.h file
  that Curl is now using when it is using a curl_config.h file.
  
  post-config-vms.h is a new file that is needed to provide VMS specific
  definitions, and most of them need to be set before the system header
  files are included.
  
  The VMS build procedure is fixed:
  
     1. Fixed to link in the correct HP ssl library.
     2. Fixed to detect if HP Kerberos is installed.
     3. Fixed to detect if HP LDAP is installed.
     4. Fixed to detect if gnv$libzshr is installed.
     5. Simplified the input parameter parsing to not use a loop.
     6. Warn that 64 bit pointer option support is not complete
        in comments.
     7. Default to IEEE floating if platform supports it so
        resulting libcurl will be compatible with other
        open source projects on VMS.
     8. Default to LARGEFILE if platform supports it.
     9. Default to enable SSL, LDAP, Kerberos, libz
        if the libraries are present.
     10. Build with exact case global symbols for libcurl.
     11. Generate linker option file needed.
     12. Compiler list option only commonly needed items.
     13. fulllist option for those who really want it.
     14. Create debug symbol file on Alpha, IA64.

- Curl_proxyCONNECT: return once CONNECT is sent

Marc Hoersken (5 Feb 2013)
- schannel: Removed extended error connection setup flag
  
  According KB975858 this flag may cause problems on Windows 7 and
  Windows Server 2008 R2 systems. Extended error information is not
  currently used by libcurl and therefore not a requirement.
  
  The flag may improve the SSL-connection shutdown in case of an
  error. This means it might be a good improvement in the future.

  darwinssl: Fix bug where packets were sometimes transmitted twice
  
  There was a bug where, if SSLWrite() returned errSSLWouldBlock but did
  succeed in transmitting at least something, then we'd incorrectly
  resend the packet. Now we never take errSSLWouldBlock as a sign that

Yang Tse (21 Jan 2013)
- xc-cc-check.m4: re-evaluate exporting and AC_SUBST'ing vars
  
  Notes:
  
  When running a configure script that has nested packages (for example
  libcurl's configure with --enable-ares and c-ares sources embedded in
  curl tree) and AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([nested-subdir]) machinery is used to
  automatically run the nested configure script from within the parent
  configure script, it happens that the nested _shell_ script will
  inherit shell variables exported from the parent _shell_ script.
  
  If for example parent configure script sets and exports LDFLAGS and LIBS
  variables with proper values in order to link either a parent library or
  program with a library which will be configured and built by a nested
  package; It will happen that when the nested configure script runs, the
  nested library does not exist yet and _any_ link-test done in the nested
  configure will fail, such as those that autoconf macros perform in order
  to detect existing compiler and its characteristics, the result is that
  the nested configure script will fail with errors such as:
  
  configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
  
  For now, we no longer export variables previously exported here.
  
  On the other hand, AC_SUBST'ing them is appropriate and even with nested
  packages each package's config.status gets its own package values.
  
  So we reinstate AC_SUBST'ing previously AC_SUBST'ed variables.

  --libcurl: fix for non-zero default options
  
  If the default value for an option taking a long as its value is non
  zero, and it is set by zero by a command line option, then that command
  line option is not reflected in --libcurl's output. This is because line
  520-521 of tool_setopt.c look like:
  
  if(!lval)
      skip = TRUE;
  
  An example of a command-line option doing so is the -k option that sets
  CURLOPT_SLL_VERIFYPEER and CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST to 0L, when the
  defaults are non-zero.

- commit bc682cbd follow-up

- build: use per-target '_CPPFLAGS' for those currently using default
  
  Automake documents that doing this will make it choose a different name
  for intermediate object files even when sharing source files across
  targets of same Makefile.am.
  
  Up to automake 1.13.1 target's intermediate object files were placed
  in the build subdirectory of the target. We depended on this, probably
  undocumented behavior, to achieve same behavior as if a per-target flag
  had been specified when building targets that actually belong to
  different Makefile.am files.
  
  It seems automake 1.13.2 is going to break behavior mentioned above.
  
  So, lets use a documented behavior in order to achieve same purpose,
  across automake versions, no matter where automake wishes to place
  intermediate object files.
  
  Our build targets that already were using a per-target '_CFLAGS' or
  '_CPPFLAGS' need no 'fixing', these were already 'fixed'. The only
  Makefile.am or Makefile.in files in libcurl's source tree touched by
  this 'fix' are tests/libtest/Makefile.inc and tests/unit/Makefile.inc.

- tests/libtest/Makefile.inc: sort build targets

- tests/Makefile.am: remove wildcard usage in EXTRA_DIST

- nss: clear session cache if a client cert from file is used
  
  This commit fixes a regression introduced in 052a08ff.
  
  NSS caches certs/keys returned by the SSL_GetClientAuthDataHook callback
  and if we connect second time to the same server, the cached cert/key
  pair is used.  If we use multiple client certificates for different
  paths on the same server, we need to clear the session cache to force
  NSS to call the hook again.  The commit 052a08ff prevented the session
  cache from being cleared if a client certificate from file was used.
  
  The condition is now fixed to cover both cases: consssl->client_nickname
  is not NULL if a client certificate from the NSS database is used and
  connssl->obj_clicert is not NULL if a client certificate from file is
  used.

- build: fix circular header inclusion with other packages
  
  This commit renames lib/setup.h to lib/curl_setup.h and
  renames lib/setup_once.h to lib/curl_setup_once.h.
  
  Removes the need and usage of a header inclusion guard foreign
  to libcurl. [1]
  
  Removes the need and presence of an alarming notice we carried
  in old setup_once.h [2]
  
  ----------------------------------------
  
  1 - lib/setup_once.h used __SETUP_ONCE_H macro as header inclusion guard
      up to commit ec691ca3 which changed this to HEADER_CURL_SETUP_ONCE_H,
      this single inclusion guard is enough to ensure that inclusion of
      lib/setup_once.h done from lib/setup.h is only done once.
  
      Additionally lib/setup.h has always used __SETUP_ONCE_H macro to
      protect inclusion of setup_once.h even after commit ec691ca3, this
      was to avoid a circular header inclusion triggered when building a
      c-ares enabled version with c-ares sources available which also has
      a setup_once.h header. Commit ec691ca3 exposes the real nature of
      __SETUP_ONCE_H usage in lib/setup.h, it is a header inclusion guard
      foreign to libcurl belonging to c-ares's setup_once.h
  
      The renaming this commit does, fixes the circular header inclusion,
      and as such removes the need and usage of a header inclusion guard
      foreign to libcurl. Macro __SETUP_ONCE_H no longer used in libcurl.
  
  2 - Due to the circular interdependency of old lib/setup_once.h and the
      c-ares setup_once.h header, old file lib/setup_once.h has carried
      back from 2006 up to now days an alarming and prominent notice about
      the need of keeping libcurl's and c-ares's setup_once.h in sync.
  
      Given that this commit fixes the circular interdependency, the need
      and presence of mentioned notice is removed.
  
      All mentioned interdependencies come back from now old days when
      the c-ares project lived inside a curl subdirectory. This commit
      removes last traces of such fact.

- mk-ca-bundle.1: mention new -f, fix outputfile output
  
  also edited a few sentences to become more verbose

- mk-ca-bundle: add -f, support passing to stdout and more
  
  1. When the downloaded data file from Mozilla is current, but the output
  bundle does not exist: continue processing to create the bundle.  The
  goal is to have the output file - not just download the latest input.
  
  2. added -f option to force re-processing the file.  Useful for
  debugging/testing the process.
  
  3. added support for output to '-' (stdout), allowing the output to be
  piped.
  
  4. All progress and error messages go to STDERR rather than STDOUT (3)
  
  5. The script opened and closed the output file many times
  unnecessarily.  It now opens it once, does the output and closes it.
  
  6. Backup of the input files happens after successful processing, not
  before.
  
  7. The output is written to a temporary file, and renamed to the
  requested name after backup - this greatly reduces the window where the
  file can be seen partially written.
  
  8. all die calls have a \n at the end to suppress perl's traceback - the
  traceback isn't useful to end users.

- INSTALL: unify the SSL library texts
  
  Make them smaller and more similar for each separate SSL library
  supported by the configure build

Yang Tse (2 Jan 2013)
- curl_setup.h: remove redundant include guard

- build and tests: curl_10char_object_name() shell function
  
  lib/objnames.inc provides definition of curl_10char_object_name() shell
  function. The intended purpose of this function is to transliterate a
  (*.c) source file name that may be longer than 10 characters, or not,
  into a string with at most 10 characters which may be used as an OS/400
  object name.
  
  Test case 1221 does unit testng of this function and also verifies
  that it is possible to generate distinct short object names for all
  curl and libcurl *.c source file names.
  
  lib/objnames-test.sh is the shell script used for test case 1221.
  
  tests/runtests.pl modified to accept shell script test cases.
  
  More details inside lib/objnames.inc and lib/objnames-test.sh

- configure.ac: replace AM_CONFIG_HEADER with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS
  
  automake 1.13 errors if AM_CONFIG_HEADER is used in configure script.
  automake 1.13 no longer autoupdates AM_CONFIG_HEADER to
  AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, thing which automake has been doing since automake
  version 1.7
  
  Given that our first automake supported version is automake 1.7,
  simply replacing AM_CONFIG_HEADER usage with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS seems
  enough to yet support same automake versions.
  
  Dave Reisner reported issue with 1.13 and provided patch.
  
  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-12/0246.html

- curl-override.m4: provide AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR definition conditionally
  
  Provide a 'traceable' AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR definition only when using
  an autoconf version that does not provide it, instead of what we were
  doing up to now of providing and overriding AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR for
  all autoconf versions.

- imap.c: Minor follow up tidy up

- imap: Code tidy up prior to adding support for the CAPABILITY command
  
  * Changing the order of the state machine to represent the order in
    which commands are sent to the server.
  
  * Reworking the imap_endofresp() function as the FETCH response doesn't
    include the command id and shouldn't be part of the length comparison
    that takes into account the id string.

- pop3_doing: Applied debug info message when function fails
  
  Applied the same debug message as used in smtp_doing() and imap_doing()
  when pop3_multi_statemach() fails.

- imap_doing: don't call imap_dophase_done() if already failed
  
  Applied the POP3 fix from commit 2897ce7dc2e1 so imap_dophase_done()
  isn't called if imap_multi_statemach() fails.

- smtp_doing: don't call smtp_dophase_done() if already failed
  
  Applied the POP3 fix from commit 2897ce7dc2e1 so smtp_dophase_done()
  isn't called if smtp_multi_statemach() fails.

Steve Holme (29 Dec 2012)
- pop3.c: Removed unnecessary POP3_STOP state changes
  
  Removed unnecessary state changes in pop3_state_starttls_resp()
  following previous fix in IMAP module.

- smtp.c: Added extra comments around SMTP_STOP state change
  
  Provided extra comments in the SMTP module following previous IMAP fix.

- imap.c: Fixed bad state error when logging in with invalid credentials
  
  Fixed a problem with the state machine when attempting to log in with
  invalid credentials. The server would report login failure but libcurl
  would not read the response due to inappropriate IMAP_STOP states being
  set after the login was sent.

Yang Tse (29 Dec 2012)

Steve Holme (28 Dec 2012)
- imap.c: Code tidy up - Part 2

- imap.c: Code tidy up - Part 1
  
  Applied some of the comment and layout changes that had already been
  applied to the pop3 and smtp code over the last 6 to 9 months.
  
  This is in preparation of adding SASL based authentication.

- pop3.c: Minor code tidy up
  
  Minor tidy up of comments and layout prior to next part of imap work.

- smtp: Minor code tidy up
  
  Minor tidy up of comments and layout prior to next part of imap work.

- curl_imap.h: Tidy up of comments to be more readable

- imap.c: Code tidy up renaming imapsendf() to imap_sendf()
  
  Renamed imapsendf() to imap_sendf() to be more in keeping with the
  other imap functions as well as Curl_pp_sendf() that it replaces.

  darwinssl: Fixed inability to disable peer verification
  
  ... on Snow Leopard and Lion
  
  Snow Leopard introduced the SSLSetSessionOption() function, but it
  doesn't disable peer verification as expected on Snow Leopard or
  Lion (it works as expected in Mountain Lion). So we now use sysctl()
  to detect whether or not the user is using Snow Leopard or Lion,
  and if that's the case, then we now use the deprecated
  SSLSetEnableCertVerify() function instead to disable peer verification.

  Issue: When building a 32bit target with large file support HP-UX
  <sys/socket.h> header file may simultaneously provide two different
  sets of declarations for sendfile and sendpath functions, one with
  static and another with external linkage. Given that we do not use
  mentioned functions we really don't care which linkage is the
  appropriate one, but on the other hand, the double declaration emmits
  warnings when using the HP-UX compiler and errors when using modern
  gcc versions resulting in fatal compilation errors.
  
  Mentioned issue is now fixed as long as we don't use sendfile nor
  sendpath functions.

  configure: fix cross pkg-config detection
  
  When cross-compiling, CURL_CHECK_PKGCONFIG was checking for the cross
  pkg-config using ${host}-pkg-config.
  
  The gold standard for doing this correctly is pkg-config's own macro,
  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG.  However, on the assumption that you have a good
  reason not to use that directly (reduced dependencies for maintainer
  builds?), the behaviour of cURL's version should at least match.
  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG uses AC_PATH_TOOL, which ultimately ends up trying
  ${host_alias}-pkg-config; this is not quite the same as what cURL does,
  and may differ because ${host} has been run through config.sub.  For
  instance, when cross-building to the armhf architecture on Ubuntu,
  ${host_alias} is arm-linux-gnueabihf while ${host} is
  arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf.  This may also have been the cause of the
  problem reported at http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-04/0224.html.
  
  AC_PATH_TOOL is significantly simpler than cURL's current code, and
  dates back to well before the current minimum of Autoconf 2.57, so let's
  use it instead.

- [Linus Nielsen Feltzing brought this change]

  Introducing a new persistent connection caching system using "bundles".
  
  A bundle is a list of all persistent connections to the same host.
  The connection cache consists of a hash of bundles, with the
  hostname as the key.
  The benefits may not be obvious, but they are two:
  
  1) Faster search for connections to reuse, since the hash
     lookup only finds connections to the host in question.
  2) It lays out the groundworks for an upcoming patch,
     which will introduce multiple HTTP pipelines.
  
  This patch also removes the awkward list of "closure handles",
  which were needed to send QUIT commands to the FTP server
  when closing a connection.
  Now we allocate a separate closure handle and use that
