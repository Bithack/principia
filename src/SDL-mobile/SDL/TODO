2.0 release checklist:
 * http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/Roadmap

 * See why windows are being rearranged.  Is the shield window not up?
 * Make sure you can create and show a fullscreen window in one step
 * Write automated test case for multi-draw APIs
 * Implement assertion code on iPhone
 * Add __WINDOWS__ in addition to __WIN32__

 * Check 1.2 revisions:
	3554 - Need to resolve semantics for locking keys on different platforms
	4874 - Do we want screen rotation?  At what level?
	4974 - Windows file code needs to convert UTF-8 to Unicode, but we don't need to tap dance for Windows 95/98
	4484, 4485 - Verify that SDL's Windows keyboard handling works correctly
	4865 - See if this is still needed (mouse coordinate clamping)
	4866 - See if this is still needed (blocking window repositioning)
