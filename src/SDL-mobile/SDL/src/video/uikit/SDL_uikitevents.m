        When the user presses the 'home' button on the iPod

        Unlike in Mac OS X, it appears there is no way to cancel the termination.

        This doesn't give the SDL user's application time to respond to an SDL_Quit event.
        So what we do is that in the UIApplicationDelegate class (SDLUIApplicationDelegate),
        when the delegate receives the ApplicationWillTerminate message, we execute
        a longjmp statement to get back here, preventing an immediate exit.
