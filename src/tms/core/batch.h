/** 
 * Batched quad rendering.
 *
 * This very simple batch object can be used to render many quads on the screen.
 * Each quad will be textured by a sprite created from a texture atlas. Only
 * one atlas can be used per render call.
 *
 * Internally, a single mesh is used and each quad is rendered as two triangles.
 * By default, the batch will use the projection matrix from tms.window_projection,
 * which orthographic 2d rendering.
 *
 * The batch will stay intact until tms_batch_clear is called. This means you can
 * create the data once and then render it many times. Alternatively, call
 * tms_batch_clear every frame if your data changes often.
 *
 * Since tms_batch extends entity, you can add it to a scene. If added to a scene,
 * the scene will manage the batch's matrices.
