currently there are shell scripts to facilitate running the built in unit tests 
on GNU/Linux and Unix like systems.

Steps:
(cd gtest-1.3.0 && ./build_gtest.sh)
(cd sqrattest && ./build_tests.sh && ./run_tests.sh)

You can edit build_tests.sh to point to the location of your squirrel include 
and library directory paths, if they are not in /usr/local/.

Batch files to do the same on Microsoft Windows: contributions welcome!
