		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

		<p>Sqrat is a C++ library for Squirrel that facilitates exposing classes 
		and other native functionality to Squirrel scripts. It is similar to 
		SqPlus, both in functionality and syntax, but seeks to address several 
		issues present in other binding libraries.</p>
		
		<p>Sqrat models the underlying Squirrel API a little more closely than most 
		other binding utilities, and this fact gives it a lot of power in 
		exchange for a couple of minor quirks in the syntax. Code is 
		straightforward and easy to read, however, and can easily be ported to 
		from existing bindings.</p>
		
		<p>Beginning in Sqrat 0.8, several utilitiy libraries are also included
		to extend the squirrel language itself with useful libraries and 
		functionalities.</p>
		
		<p>Sqrat has been tested against Squirrel 2.1.1 through 2.2.3 and 3.0 to 3.0.4. Other 
		versions may work fine, but the author makes no promises!</p>
