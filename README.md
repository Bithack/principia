# Principia Open Source Project
![Principia](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bithack/principia/master/data-src/github-image0.gif)

Principia is a sandbox physics game originally released in November 2013. It is the successor to the 2011 Android hit game "Apparatus". In August of 2022 Principia was released as open source, and is now being developed as an open source project by the Principia community.

Principia runs on anything with a recent enough version of Windows, Linux or Android. Experimental ports to Haiku OS and macOS are also available, and work to port Principia to other platforms are very welcome.

## Binary builds
Binary builds of Principia for Windows, Android and Linux are available on the [downloads page](https://principia-web.se/download).

There are also nightly build artifacts for Windows, Android and Linux that get automatically built by GitHub CI on each commit, see [Actions](https://github.com/Bithack/principia/actions). Keep in mind these may be broken at times during development, and you are recommended to use the release builds instead.

The Android version is available on F-Droid [here](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.bithack.principia/).
