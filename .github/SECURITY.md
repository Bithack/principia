# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We only support the latest stable version for security issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you have found a bug that could be exploited by a malicious actor by playing a level or in any other way where an end-user could be victimised, then please responsibly disclose it privately by email to:

- ROllerozxa, project maintainer \<rollerozxa@voxelmanip.se\>

We will evaluate possible means of mitigating it on the community site and/or swiftly release a new version of Principia to fix the issue, depending on the severity. If it is deemed to not be a security-critical issue then we'll ask you to file a public bug report issue.
