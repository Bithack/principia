In Memory of Keith Tripp
------------------------

I would like to dedicate a few lines to Keith Tripp, aka zardOz. By definition the go-to guy when you had a Principia question, Keith helped newcomers understand and get started building things. Keith created hundreds of tutorial levels and was always one of the first to learn the latest object. Unfortunately, I was notified of his passing late 2015. There will always be tutorials, but never another Keith Tripp.

I was told Principia inspired Keith to become interested in programming. He would have loved to see Principia being open sourced.
