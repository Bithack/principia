Fixed a crash related to emitting of robots with jetpacks equipped. (thanks Golden)
LuaScript tracker function now shows the objects change as well.
Polygon now have their own 4 connections at the midpoint inbetween corners.

PC:
Activating RCs/Backpacks/any activator in adventure mode should be a bit more intuitive now, showing different bindings for different objects.

Android:
State-loading a sandbox level no longer removes the option to return to sandbox.
